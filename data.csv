through my learning journey, I acquired a comprehensive knowledge of the fundamentals in programming and working with databases and database management systems, from data modeling and design to data retrieval and querying. Theoretical and basic applied knowledge behind well-known algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

In every team, giving and helping out everyone is my priority. Also, I have an entrepreneurial spirit. I learned a lot about teamwork during university and volunteer work. There is no bad team, but bad team management. Everyone gives when their qualifications are acknowledged, their time and opinions are appreciated. Empowering each member's skills is the main factor for a team's thrive. I, however, believe this is the most challenging step and is commonly misjudged due to ignorance of what makes it successful.

It is research and planning that I excel at, and through trials and errors, or by revolving around with experienced people, I have undoubtedly learned and developed these skills. Planning entails an appreciation of the difficulties of the tasks and deep knowledge of what each requires. Failure is a result of the unfamiliarity with the demand and the challenges that they present. For this reason, planning has always been associated with research.

My career path has not been the most straightforward. I was offered an opportunity to swim in college and that’s how I moved to the United States. At the time, swimming was my priority and my professional career was just a distant thought in the back of my head. Thus, I never truly stopped to think about what career I wanted to pursue.

During my Bachelor’s I changed my major approximately 5,000 times (and that’s a lowball estimate). After I finished my Bachelor’s, I got myself contemplating life and what I wanted to do with it. I found myself to be a very curious and logical person who likes to solve problems and approaches day-to-day tasks with a scientific view. So, I decided to do my Master’s in Information Systems. 

Throughout my journey in higher education, I fell in love with Data Science for those same reasons. I find it very interesting and exciting to understand and analyze actual phenomena by using scientific methods, processes, and algorithms to extract knowledge and insights from data.

One of my favorite classes during my Master’s was Business Intelligence. In that class, we were assigned to read the book “Hands-On Predictive Analytics with Python” by Alvaro Fuentes, and it really opened my eyes. I loved learning about predictive analytics and using a variety of statistical and quantitative methods to make use of data in order to make predictions.

Now, I find myself diving into books, articles, and Kaggle datasets seeking more knowledge. It was a calling rather than an interest! My specialties include quickly learning new skills, problem-solving, machine learning, Python, PySpark, SQL, and Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. I am also well-versed in Tableau, Hadoop, Spark, Git, and GitHub. I’ve started learning other machine learning libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow, and also neural network algorithms and deep learning methods.

Prior to that, I worked as a Lead Instructor at General Assembly teaching students core machine learning and data driven problem-solving skills. I also designed training courses with multiple local datasets to solve business problems. Students graduated under my mentorship now hold key KSA public and private sector data driven positions.

Before becoming an AI Educator, I worked as an application developer and have developed multiple applications catering to the Insurance Sector. My team developed a Motor Claims System and integrated it with the KSA car insurance Najm. In addition, I developed a document archiving system integrated with the core insurance system and other third party applications.

On the personal front, I have participated in numerous hackathons such as the AI Artathon where my team used deep learning algorithms and drones to create pieces of art. I have also worked on multiple projects such as a neural network based chat bot for Slack and WhatsApp, KSA weather history crawler, sentiment analyzer for hotel reviews, etc.

I graduated from Cairo University with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. I have vast volunteering experience and extracurricular activities that I have done over the span of five years. For example, I have volunteered with Resala - an orphanage where I used to volunteer every week.

As a child, I built a strong reading habit to whet my appetite for new ideas. Over the years, I realized that ideas and data are inseparable and learnt to quantify ideas with data. This gave me a keen eye for detail and nurtured strong articulation skills.

My segue into Analytics began with Mu Sigma, a data science company where I worked for 3 years. Having closely worked with experts in the line of analytics has helped me understand how businesses are adapting to the new data wave and the broad range of analytical functions applicable to online marketing. I find the profound impact that data can create and how it can drive changes in economy, governance and society to be truly exciting.

I completed my MS in Analytics at UT Austin in May 2020. A rich, vibrant and highly competitive ecosystem at UT helped me sharpen my skills at solving problems that lie at the confluence of Business, Math and Technology.

Here, mouse embryonal carcinoma cells (P19 EC) were used as a model system to study the role of HMGN proteins. The aim was to develop a lentiviral system to investigate the role of this protein in stem cell. N2 knockdown in undifferentiated P19 EC cells resulted in the down regulation of Oct4 protein levels. ChIP assays showed that N2 binding over the Oct4 gene was absent in N2 knockdown cells. Furthermore, the binding of N1 at TSS was increased in the absence of N2. Consistent with the reduction in Oct4 expression, the level of the active histone modification, H3K4me3, were also reduced at the Oct4 gene. These results support the role of N2 in the regulation of Oct4 expression in P19 cells which may be important for maintaining stem cell pluripotency.","three projects were giving to initiate novel research path focusing on the effect of epigenetic (miRNA, DNA methylation) in COPD and IPF.

Artificial intelligence calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and even I grown my self in the data science fill the deficiencies.
I love applying layers of ML models and watching my models improving each other and serve the purpose they are built for, It's kinda like there is a human intelligence behind building these intelligent models, it's oddly satisfying but always I need still keep my creative flare intact.

An important purposes of the semantic web is to make the available resources clearly organized, structured and machine-identifiable. This facilitates accessing, understanding and linking large data repositories, which can be used in a variety of useful applications; moreover, it allows software agents to process and analyse the data which will likely result in the emergence of new useful information.
In this thesis, an application has been developed to enrich the semantic web with machine-readable description of scientific publications related to the field of computing. This system mainly applies hierarchical classification techniques based on the local binary classifiers (SVM, NB) approach to categorize given documents according to the ACM taxonomy.

I am looking for a new leadership opportunity where I can have the autonomy to drive business performance by collaborative development and implementation of human-centred data products and process automation to create new values from data assets to meet the business needs. I value a senior leadership team who can act as a role model to cultivate and uphold a data-centric culture, understand the essential need of upskilling, reward, and recognition to develop and maintain happy, motivated, and productive workforce, and work towards closing the gap between practices and the actual achievement of diversity, inclusion, and equality in the workplace. 

My ambition is to democratise data to enable businesses to accelerate regular, proactive, and insight-driven decisions from self-service analytics platforms. I am also passionate about exploring improvement opportunities through identifying gaps in current business processes, leveraging available data and resources to develop applicable analytical solutions, and getting stakeholders engaged in frequent communications for support, project update and agile decision making to effectively improve productivity.

I enjoy taking new challenges in driving technological and organisational transformation and engaging business leaders to lead through the change by translating into benefit, meaning and purpose behind so that they can build better understanding of the business strategy and their roles to enable success.",,"●	I established and owned the team’s growth direction focusing on data workflow automation and self-service analytics to support the fast-paced claims operations to meet our strategic objectives on operations management transformation and data democratisation
●	I led the team to build and deploy the first ever self-service Tableau data platform in the company on a large scale, providing essential operational KPIs to over 120 Claims leaders and commercial executives to identify and detect scenarios relating to inefficiencies, opportunities, and threats, and enabling proactive operational solutions to drive productivity across the entire department. I established good design principles and took ownership of data assurance and governance to protect the company’s reputation and obligations, as well as to strategically control data output to prevent unauthorised disclosure of data currently accessible by a high volume of users. 
●	I redesigned and automated critical Excel reporting in SQL to ~700 colleagues which reduced 4 hours per day from manual data input activities to full automation and enabled the data output to be delivered before 9AM
●	I built a claim workflow forecasting framework that transforms a 20-year-old departmental target operating model. Continued to lead scope and defined analytical solutions to ensure the success of the Test and Learn programme in advance of the department-wide implementation of the resource planning model
●	I introduced new opportunities to develop more in-house software applications to the wider team using cost-effective R Shiny framework to control business processes and improve productivity in other areas of the Claims department
●	I incorporated statistical methods through continual R&D to deliver new Tableau features for effective storytelling and action recommendation. I suggested project teams leverage more hypothesis testing to track the effectiveness of new changes made to improve the Guidewire ClaimCentre system","●	I transferred a core underwriting technical pricing model from Emblem to an H2O cluster to optimise the duration and frequency of model training and validation. The process used the xgboost algorithm to predict average claims costs on each policyholder, which predominantly involves hyperparameter tuning through grid search on training and validating several models to find an optimal set of hyperparameters for the particular problem.
●	I worked with senior actuaries to examine and compare the best-performing predictive models using ggplot2 in R to identify strengths and weaknesses in the prediction power of each model to decide the final model, or to re-train the models with a different approach to improving the model fit and performance.
●	I liaised with a wide range of colleagues in deploying the R Shiny application into production. I documented the complex algorithms in a flowchart in Visio to illustrate the offer calculations and the code for handover to the solutions architect and development team to build the Guidewire ClaimCentre application in Javascript.
●	I peer-reviewed existing project documentations and model scripts produced by other data scientists in R to improve code quality, examine data integrity, and verify model assumption and validation. As part of this, I built a new data dictionary for a vehicle database in Python (json).",,Grade: First class with honours,Grade: Merit,Information Systems,Unkown

As an IT person, I was eager to start my career path and to occupy a position related to my major and my passion, however, I end up with a career that was more related to a business field. 
As the years went by, I found that I was lucky enough to work in a business field with an information technology background. Since I was able to see the business challenges from a different perspective than any other colleague. (Technical side).
This kind of experience expanded my knowledge and gave me a clear vision of what the business expects from IT. So I am always enthusiastic to use my background to leverage the business and making it more efficient and competitive. 

I have worked for five years in the Supply Chain Management department as a Senior Buyer in KFSH&RC. I was responsible for locating and procuring products, supplies, and materials needed by other departments. My job duties helped me to build strong communication skills and taught me various aspects of the business. 
As I mentioned before, working in a business field never let me forgot that I’m an IT person in the first place. And since I was working in a big hospital with over 10,000.00 employees, I found myself dealing with a lot of data.
 
One of the initiatives I made, required me to collect some data to analyze it and extract from it useful information that can be used for business interests. During this process, I found myself thrilled to deal with everything related to data, starting from collecting it, through manipulating and end with visualizing and presenting it in a way that can be easier for the human brain to understand what’s really going on in the business and thus will help for better decision making as well as business enhancement. 
The experience itself that I went through gave me a strong vision of what I want and where I’m going and where I want to be. I am truly fascinated dealing with data and I strongly believe that data is power and it’s the essential element behind the success of any organization if it used wisely.
